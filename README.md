Project for Code Academy Berlin.

This was my first project using JavaScript.
The goal of the project was to create a Website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX, APIs, JSON, Postman.
I used a free API providing a list of entries, use AJAX to make live calls, transform the data in JSON format and display them using DOM manipulation.

About the pages:
On the Homepage is a Read More Read Less Button, to show more or less of the text.

On the Species Page I used an API about extincted animals. With the endpoints of the API, I made a dropdown filter and a search field and combined both.
Filter options are available for the location and the search is available for the name and the location.
Clicking on the resulting animal card it will open a new page with more information about this specific animal.
Also you can find loading spinners on the pages with the animals.

Styling was done with CSS and Bootstrap Components.
