Project for Code Academy Berlin.

The goal of the project was to create a Website using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, (AJAX), APIs, JSON.
I used a free API providing a list of entries (, use AJAX to make live calls, transform the data in JSON format and display them using DOM manipulation.)

I used an API about extincted animals. With the endpoints of the API, I made some filters and a search.

There is a datalist to 'suggest' search results from my initial fetch if the user doesn't know a specific name of an extincted animal.
????Clicking "more" will provide access to a shuffle function, and a "type" selector which will limit results from both the search and shuffle to the selected type/s. ????
???? Clicking the resulting animla card will open a model with more information. Filter options are available for the location, lastRecord & commonName. ????

Most styled elements are done with a Theme, which was molded with Bootstrap 4 Components.
