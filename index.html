    <h1>Forgotten Giants: Exploring Extinct Species</h1>

    <button type="button" class="btn .btn:before">Base class</button>

    <p>Throughout history, countless species have vanished from our planet, leaving behind only fossils, stories, and memories. These creatures, from ancient giants to more recent extinctions, were once integral to the delicate balance of our ecosystems. Some roamed the Earth millions of years ago, while others were lost in recent centuries, often due to human activity.

        As we reflect on their disappearance, we come to understand how deeply we are connected to the natural world. Each extinct species leaves a void, not just in biodiversity, but in the intricate web of life that we all share. While some extinctions were caused by natural events, many have been accelerated by human actions—overhunting, habitat destruction, and climate change. It's a sobering reminder of the power we hold over the fate of the world’s living creatures.
        
        Let us take a moment to appreciate the immense beauty and diversity of these lost species, and recognize our responsibility in protecting the fragile species that remain. By understanding the causes of extinction, we can work together to ensure that future generations will not only learn about these magnificent creatures through history but will also have the opportunity to witness the wonders of our living planet.
